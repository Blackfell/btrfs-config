# btrfs-config
Small script to simplify BTRFS Deployment on a single disk

## What it do

This script just guides me through partitioning, formatting and configuring 
BTRFS snapshots for a personal or home storage server or NAS machine. It 
creates a number of sub-volumes, which are shown as examples, but should be 
configured as you need.
